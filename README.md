# VQ-VAE
This is my implementation of Vector Quantized VAE trained on ImageNet data

You need to download model from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maunish/vqvae-imagenet) and place it in model directory and name it "model.bin" before running main.py file.

Here is the orignal research paper of Vector Quantized VAE <br/>
[Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937)

Training code for the model in Pytorch can be found here.<br/>
